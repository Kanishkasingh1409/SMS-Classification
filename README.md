# SMS-Classification

**Introduction to SMS Classification Using Python in Data Science**

Text classification is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) and data science. It involves categorizing or labeling text data into predefined categories or classes. One common application of text classification is the categorization of SMS (Short Message Service) messages, also known as text messages.

In this tutorial, we will explore how to build a SMS classification system using Python and popular NLP libraries. The goal is to automatically classify SMS messages into relevant categories, such as spam or not spam, customer inquiries, promotional messages, etc.

**Prerequisites:**
Before we dive into building the SMS classification system, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **Python:** You should have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. **Python Libraries:** We'll be using several Python libraries for NLP and machine learning, including `NLTK` (Natural Language Toolkit), `scikit-learn`, and `pandas`. You can install these libraries using pip:

   ```
   pip install nltk scikit-learn pandas
   ```

3. **SMS Dataset:** You'll need a labeled SMS dataset for training and testing the classification model. You can find SMS datasets online or create your own with labeled messages.

**Steps for SMS Classification:**

Here's an overview of the steps we'll follow to build the SMS classification system:

1. **Data Preparation:** Load and preprocess the SMS dataset. This includes text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction.

2. **Text Vectorization:** Convert text data into numerical vectors using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings.

3. **Split Data:** Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

4. **Model Selection:** Choose a suitable machine learning or deep learning model for text classification. Common choices include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and neural networks.

5. **Model Training:** Train the selected model on the training data.

6. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

7. **Prediction:** Use the trained model to predict the category of new SMS messages.

8. **Deployment:** If needed, deploy the SMS classification model in a real-world application or service.

Throughout this tutorial, we will provide Python code examples and explanations for each step. By the end of this project, you will have a functional SMS classification system that can automatically categorize incoming text messages, which can be useful for tasks like spam detection or customer support.

Let's get started by preparing our SMS dataset and cleaning the text data.
